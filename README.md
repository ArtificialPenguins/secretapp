Moves is a cross platform application designed to give investors & stock holders information on legal, published insider trading within a company. This information is currently publicly known but not easily accessed. Moves will publish this to the official moves app & give shareholders realtime, push notifications for when either a highranking executive sells or a large hedgefund executes an unusually large purchae order.

## business model

Moves will operate on a freemium software as a service basis, with a low monthly subscription (3-8$), and possibly a multiple tiered system. This part is highly open to revision & will only be thought over once the initial app is competed.

We will design a relatively simple UI for Smartmoney, & import information via json. Will possibly bring new talent onto the project to make this more seamless.
